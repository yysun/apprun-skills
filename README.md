# AppRun Skills

End-to-end guidance for building AppRun applications in TypeScript using the MVU (Model-View-Update) pattern. This skill covers component patterns, event handling, state management (including async generators), routing/navigation with parameters and guards, and testing with Vitest.

## What's Included

- **Project Setup**: Vite configuration, TypeScript setup, and recommended folder structure
- **Component Patterns**: Stateful class components, modal components, functional components, and typed events
- **Event System**: AppRun directives (`$bind`, `$onclick`, etc.) and event communication patterns
- **State Management**: Update handlers (sync, async, generators), state initialization rules
- **Routing**: Component registration, navigation, route parameters, and programmatic routing
- **Testing**: Unit testing patterns with Vitest
- **Development Checklist**: Complete checklist for building AppRun components
